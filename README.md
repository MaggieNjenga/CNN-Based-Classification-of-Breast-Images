# CNN-Based-Classification-of-Breast-Images
## Introduction
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques,
particularly custom CNNs and modern CNNs, to develop an
automated image classification system that can accurately
distinguish between benign and malignant breast tissues.
Histopathological image analysis, which involves examining
tissue samples under a microscope, is a key method for
diagnosing breast cancer. The input to the model is a colored
RGB histopathological image of breast tissue with 3 channels.
The input is trained on a convolutional neural network to
output a predicted cancer type. The output is binary, where 0
is benign(non-cancerous) and 1 is malignant (cancerous).
